# Basic Task Manager

## Description:

* This is a basic task manager which can be used for keeping track of various users and tasks for a small business. This task manager allows a user to keep record of:

 * Who is registered as an employee, 
 * Store all the employee usernames and passwords
 * Who is doing what task, 
 * The relevant start and end dates of that task, 
 * Whether a task has been completed or not, and 
 * View basic statistics of the business (users and tasks delegation) data.

## What/who the project is for:

* This program can be used by any small business owner (or non profit institution owned) who would like to keep track of the employees and their relevant tasks at any given time. 

## How the project works:

* Users for the program can add tasks, view all tasks, view all personal tasks, and view statistics of the business.
* The "Admin" user however has all the above options but also has one more. **Only the "Admin" user is allowed to add/register new users. Once the user has been registered (ie stored in a text file), they will be able to log on themselves.**
* Users will need to enter their username and password to log in, provided the Admin user has registered that specific user. 
* The relevant options as to what the user can choose to do will be available once the user has logged in. They are then able to pick which task they would like to do.

## Goal of the project:

* This program is to assist a small organisation/business with basic tasks within their business (or household/non-profit). The goal here is to provide a simple and straightforward platform for the average user to still be able to maintain an effective, straightforward, and digital tracking of their business.
